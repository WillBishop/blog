**Hi!**, I'm here to ask you guys what *you* want to see on this blog. I'd like to write tutorials and maybe do QnA stuff if I can actually get enough questions. 

Since I specialize in WatchKit development, including releasing two apps ([Chirp for Twitter](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/chirp-for-twitter/id1397430041?mt=8) and [Nano for Reddit](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nano-for-reddit/id1344097185?ls=1&mt=8)), I figure it makes sense for me to write about WatchKit.

Any and all of my tutorials will use Apple's [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) language, but if you're reading this I can assume you're probably already familiar with it.

Anyway, leave a comment below with what you'd like to see and I'll get right to it!
