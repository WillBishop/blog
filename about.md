Hi, I'm Will Bishop, I'm 16, and I live in Adelaide, South Australia. I started developing Apple Watch apps when I was 15, starting with [Nano for Reddit](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nano-for-reddit/id1344097185?ls=1&mt=8), and then [Chirp for Twitter](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/chirp-for-twitter/id1397430041?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4). I've been writing Swift code for over 2 years, and specialising in Apple Watch development since December 2016. You can keep up to date with my projects on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/WillRBishop). At the time of writing this I'm developing MiniWiki, in an attempt to bring Wikipedia to the watch for free.
